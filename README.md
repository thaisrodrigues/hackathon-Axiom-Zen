Axiom Zen questions:
<br><br>
How long did the assignment take? <br>
It took 28 hours.
<br><br>
Did you learn anything new in the process?<br>
Robson: Improved my skills on Sketch and manage too short deadlines as well. <br>
Thais: Learned some new JS tricks and a some things on Sketch.<br>
<br><br>
What was the hardest part?<br>
Besides the short time, the hardest part was to restrict ourselves to keep it simple and an elegant solution.<br>
<br><br>
If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be? 
Maybe we could have started prototyping earlier, experimenting even more different solutions.

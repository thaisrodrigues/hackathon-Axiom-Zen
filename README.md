##LANDING PAGE DESIGN & FRONT-END KICKER UX DESIGN

TEAM:
THAIS RODRIGUES - FRONT END 
ROBSON ZUMKELLER - UX

Axiom Zen questions:

How long did the assignment take? 
It took 28 hours.

Did you learn anything new in the process?
Robson: Improved my skills on Sketch and manage too short deadlines as well. 
Thais: Learned some new JS tricks and a some things on Sketch.

What was the hardest part?
Besides the short time, the hardest part was to restrict ourselves to keep it simple and an elegant solution.

If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be? 
Maybe we could have started prototyping earlier, experimenting even more different solutions.
